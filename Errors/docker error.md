It looks like you're having issues with installing Docker due to unmet dependencies. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Update Package List**:
   First, make sure your package list is up to date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Upgrade Existing Packages**:
   Upgrade any existing packages that may be outdated:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Try installing `containerd` manually:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install containerd
   ```

4. **Install Docker Again**:
   Once `containerd` is installed, try installing Docker again:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
   ```

5. **Fix Broken Packages**:
   If you still encounter issues, you can try fixing broken packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

6. **Check Held Packages**:
   Sometimes packages may be held back. You can check for held packages with:
   ```bash
   dpkg --get-selections | grep hold
   ```

   If you find any held packages, you can unhold them using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-mark unhold package_name
   ```

7. **Use the Docker Official Repository** (Optional):
   If the above steps don't work, consider using the official Docker repository. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
   ```

   Then add the Docker repository:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install \
       apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates \
       curl \
       software-properties-common

   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce
   ```

After trying these steps, check if Docker is installed correctly by running:
```bash
docker --version
```
